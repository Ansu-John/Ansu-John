* Big Data Analysis
Analytics is art to find patterns in data. The ability to divide vast amount of data into logical groups and the ability to find hidden components. Using the below projects we perform data analysis on big data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions and supporting decision-making. 

[Big Data Analysis](https://github.com/Ansu-John/Big-Data-Analysis) - demonstrates the various Spark RDD / Dataframe operations using PySpark library. 
 
** Spark MLlib 
Apache Spark MLlib is the Apache Spark machine learning library consisting of common learning algorithms and utilities, including classification, regression, clustering, collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, and underlying optimization primitives. 

[Extarcting, transforming and selecting features from data](https://github.com/Ansu-John/MLlib-Working-with-Features) - exploer various ways to extarcting, transforming and selecting features from data for machine learning
[Linear Regression with Spark](https://github.com/Ansu-John/Linear-Regression-with-Spark) - demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression with PySpark.
[Logistic Regression with Spark](https://github.com/Ansu-John/Logistic-Regression-with-Spark) - demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression with PySpark.
[ML Clustering](https://github.com/Ansu-John/ML-Clustering) - demonstrates the various clustering algorithms using PySpark.
[ML Classification](https://github.com/Ansu-John/ML-Classification) - demonstrates the various classification algorithms using PySpark.
[Movie Recommender System](https://github.com/Ansu-John/Movie-Recommender-System) - implementation of movie recommendation systems using  Apache Spark ML alternating least squares (ALS)

* Artificial intelligence (AI)
[Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/Ansu-John/Natural-Language-Processing) -
** Deep Learning 
[Deep Learning Classification](https://github.com/Ansu-John/Deep-Learning-Classification) - implementation of image classification model to identify class the input image belongs to.
[Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/Ansu-John/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection) - predict fraudulent credit card transactions using TensorFlow, Keras, K Neighbors, Decision Tree, SVM Regression and Logistic Regression classfiers 

* Real Life Data Science Projects 

[IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition](https://github.com/Ansu-John/IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition) - predict using LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier
[AB Testing](https://github.com/Ansu-John/AB-Testing) - exploration of data from database using python libraries : pyodbc and matplotlib libraries.
