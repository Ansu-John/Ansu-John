**Hi there,**

I am Ansu John, and am working as Data Analyst. I joined Github to publish data science projects exploring various analytics tools and techniques and to identify best practices in the process. If you are also interested, please find the project details below.

Do message me in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ansu-john/) for any comments / suggestions. 

Enjoy machine learning!
